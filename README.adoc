# Resume

This repository contains my resume compiled in LaTeX using a very nice modern theme

## Credits

LaTeX is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia. You can find out more about it here: http://www.latex-project.org/

If you are looking for LaTeX resume templates, I would recommend looking at this nice list an anonymous person put together: http://linuxandfriends.com/2009/12/28/latex-resume-templates/

The moderncv theme for my resume is contributed by Xavier Danaux and can be downloaded here: http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/ (https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv)

## Prerequisites

You will need to have LaTeX installed on your system.

## Compiling the Resume

Simply use the `pdflatex` command in your terminal:

  pdflatex resume.tex



## Notes

You are free to take my `.tex` file and modify it to create your own resume. Please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission, though!
